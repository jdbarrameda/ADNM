This Java program provides a simple implementation of anti-differencing, a technique used to reverse the differencing operation applied to time series data. Differencing is commonly used to stabilize the mean of a time series by differencing consecutive observations. This program takes the differenced data and the original data before differencing as input and performs anti-differencing to recover the original data. It's useful in various applications such as time series analysis, forecasting, and signal processing.
